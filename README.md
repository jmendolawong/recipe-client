# Recipe Catalog

### Introduction
Recipe Catalog is an experimental React application that digitizes recipe books. 
Users are able to bookmark recipes they discover online, storing them in the Recipe Catalog.

### How it works
All recipes are bookmarked in a easy to read display. 
Adding a recipe is simply inputting the name, website link, and a note to attach to the recipe.
The name and the note is on the recipe page. Clicking on the title opens up the website in another tab.
